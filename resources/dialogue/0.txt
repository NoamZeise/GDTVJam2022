A female mummy awakens from a sarcophagus.  Not knowing what her name is, she wanders and meets with Anubis.
P
What is this place? Who am I? I can’t...... I can’t remember.
A
Who dares to trespass the walkway of Pharaohs?
P
Gasps I... I......who are.....
A
I am the Lord of the Underworld, Anubis.
B
This is the sacred book of the underworld, the book of the dead. It reveals to me the names of those who should pass onto the afterlife.
B
It does not show me you who are. I see visions of your mummification.... You are a Pharaoh, but one who does not know who she is..
B
I see visions of those filled with envy attempting to erase you from history. I see those filled by greed breaking into your sacred tomb to rob you.
A
If you wish to pass on, you must undergo a series of trials.
A
These trials shall be the key to unlocking your forgotten memories and restore your name into the book of the dead.
A
Go Pharaoh, escape the eternal darkness and master the light! Let the trials begin!
